## What's next for WeVideo
In the future, we would like to add many more features like commenting and flagging videos, to create a community-based moderation system for inappropriate content. Furthermore, we would like to extend our statistics to display number of times a video has been reshared, along with the ability to trace the video back to the original poster.
